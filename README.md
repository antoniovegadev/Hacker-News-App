<h1 align="center">TBD - A Hacker News iOS Client</h1>

## Motivation
There is no unique motivation for this project, since there's quite a few
Hacker News clients for iOS. The motivation here is to make an app that I 
would love using day-to-day, and to have it on the App Store as my first
app.

My main goals for this project is to...
* learn more about SwiftUI 
* get more experience with TDD (Test-Driven-Development)

## Project Definition

### What is the project?
This is a personal project to build a fast, intuitive, and simple-designed iOS
client for the popular [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) forum. The 
project is going to be solved using Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, and Hacker News open source
[API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API). It will allow users to easily browse 
and digest Hacker News.

### What is the MVP (Minimal Viable Product)?
The minimal viable product is an application that...
* Digest Hacker News feed (Read Only - no plans for user sign-in/posting).
* Digest comment sections of each post.

### What are the nice to haves?
* Allow customization of app (e.g. themes, custom font, font-sizing, custom app icon)
* iOS Widget Support
* iPad support 

### When will the project be complete?
The goal is to have the app completed by the end of 2022, meeting all MVP features.
